# Kilo Text Editor (Following a Tutorial)

This repository contains my implementation of the `kilo` text editor, based on the tutorial from [viewsourcecode.org](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html).

## ðŸ“Œ Disclaimer
This is **not my original work**. I am following the step-by-step guide from [viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) to learn more about terminal-based text editors and low-level C programming.
